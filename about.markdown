<h3>What I'm working on</h3>

Something I hope to launch very, very soon. 👀

At least I hope I will, I've not watched any WWDC session videos yet!

<h3>What I'm reading</h3>

I just finished the [Black Jacobins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Jacobins), which has been on my list for a long time. I'm also slowly progressing through a biography of [Georges Danton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Danton). Can you tell I like revolutionary history?

I also have Turgenev's Ася at about 20% complete, to practice my Russian. I've not been very good at that lately. 😅

<h2 class="centered">Contact</h2>

I want to make things, go places, and meet interesting people. If you can help with any of that, give me a shout! I live in East London.
