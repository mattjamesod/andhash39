			<h3 >What I'm working on</h3>

			<p>My latest iOS project, Timescape, is now out! üéâ It's a big picture calendar to let you think about a whole year at once: go download it <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timescape-year-planner/id6744339214">here</a>.</p>
			
			<p>I'm working on updates for Timescape as feedback comes in, and I'm also tinkering around with another project I've had on the backburner for a while. It doesn't have a name yet; I don't know if it will end up being open sourced or sold on the (Mac!) App Store.</p>
			
			<h3>What I'm reading</h3>
			
			<p><strong>Non-fiction</strong>: I just finished a biography of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Danton">Georges Danton</a>. The French Revolution is one of my favourite topics, and Danton himself is a beast. Unfortunately the book, while well written, was pretty sexist. My girl <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Roland">Madame Roland</a> got the worst of it.</p>

			<p>I also picked up a programming book: the 20th anniversay edition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer">the Pragmatic Programmer</a>. I'll probably write up my thoughts on it when I'm done.</p>

			<p><strong>Fiction</strong>: Brandon Sanderson launched another book, so I decided it was time to reread <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/pages/the-stormlight-archive-series">the Stormlight Archive</a>. I have Way of Kings down, and I'm part of the way through Warbreaker.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Russian</strong>: I read exactly one (short) chapter of Turgenev's <i>–ê—Å—è</i> since I last updated this page. It's something!</p>
