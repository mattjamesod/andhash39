			<h3 >What I'm working on</h3>
			
			<p>I just launched a minor redesign of this site! Well, I haven't yet, I'm still working on this page. Time travel!</p>

			<p>My latest iOS project should also be announced and launched very, very soon! Watch this space.</p>
			
			<h3>What I'm reading</h3>
			
			<p><strong>History</strong>: I just finished <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Jacobins">The Black Jacobins</a></i>, which has been on my list for a long time, and highly reccommended. I'm also slowly progressing through a biography of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Danton">Georges Danton</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>Fiction</strong>: the new Brandon Sanderson <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ebee384a-a092-4f3a-bc6e-587a0e6ab2b5">secret project</a> dropped this month, so that's going right into my veins. I'm also still thinking about Austen's <i>Persuasion</i>.</p>
			
			<p>I also have Turgenev's <i>Ася</i> at about 20% complete, to practice my Russian.</p>
