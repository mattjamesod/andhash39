			<h3>What I'm working on</h3>

			<p>The iOS 26 updates for Timescape and Thought Path need to be done. It's going to be minimal updates to support the new OS, since the beta process this time round simply hasn't been stable enough to commit to the redeisgn while I also have a full time job.</p>
			
			<h3>What I've Been Reading</h3>
			
			<p><strong>Finished</strong>: the latest Thubron travel novel, about <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/reviews/694cc840-f630-43e2-8ea4-4999c371fcd8">the Amur river</a>. Also still progressing through my re-read of <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/pages/the-stormlight-archive-series">the Stormlight Archive</a>, and finished <i>Edgedancer</i>.</p>

			<p><strong>In progress</strong>: the 20th anniversay edition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer">the Pragmatic Programmer</a>, Turgenev's <i>Ася</i>, and Austen's <i>Northanger Abbey</i>. I'm going to read all of Austen this year!</p>
