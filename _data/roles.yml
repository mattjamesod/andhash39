    I joined AVAMAE after graduating from my master's degree in 2019. It was here I learnt the the basics of web development, being responsible for the maintenance of a large legacy code base with a large number of users.

    The team here used a Microsoft stack: most of my time was spent building features in .NET core, or fetching data and writing stored procedures in SQL Server.
