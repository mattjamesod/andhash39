<p>Thought Path is an inbox to quickly capture all your thoughts, ideas, and tasks. Easily see the output of your brain over time, on a map, or in search results.</p>

<div>

<p>You can integrate Thought Path with Shortcuts, to automate capturing and reviewing your thoughts.</p>

<p>Though Path is free to use indefinitely, but you will need to review and archive all your thoughts once you reach a cap of 15. Pro users can remove this limit with a subscription fee.</p>
