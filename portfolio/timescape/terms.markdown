# Terms of Use

<p>Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Timescape application ("Timescape" or “Application”) operated by Matthew James O'Donnell (“I” or “me”).</p>

<p>By accessing and using Timescape, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and the Privacy Policy. If you do not accept these Terms and the Privacy Policy, you are not authorized to use the Services. I may modify these Terms and the Privacy Policy at any time, and such modification will be effective upon posting to the Application.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif">Subscriptions</h2>

<p>Some features of the Application are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic monthly or yearly basis (“Billing Cycle”).</p>

<p>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless it is cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.</p>

<p>All Subscriptions may be final and non-refundable. By accepting these terms, you agree that I am not required to provide a refund for any reason. I may change, modify, or eliminate features of the Subscription at any time, with or without notice. Any Subscription fee change will not go into effect automatically; you must opt into the fee change to continue using the Subscription after the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif">Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>In no event shall I, nor my partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Application; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Application; (iii) any content obtained from the Application; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif">Representations and Warranties</h2>

<p>Your use of the Application is at your sole risk. The Application is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. The Application is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, accuracy, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance.</p>

<p>I do not warrant that the Application will function uninterrupted or will be available at any particular time or location.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold font-serif">Governing Law</h2>

<p>These Terms will be governed by English law. Any dispute arising from, or related to, these Terms shall be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>
