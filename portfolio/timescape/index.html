<p>Timescape is a calendar app that shows your entire year: 52 weeks in a grid, no gaps. Plan travel, check upcoming birthdays, and think seriously about the time you have available.</p>

<div>	
	<p>See your calendars come alive, as your colours for travel, work, family and everything else decorate your Timescape. You can see any day of the year with a single tap, and all the events on that day appear in a ribbon below the grid.</p>
	
	<p>It's easier to use than explain - give it a download, and check it out with a 7 day free trial!</p>
