# About Timescape

Timescape is an iPhone calendar utility designed to be used in tandem with a primary calendar app like Apple Calendar or Fantastical. Timescape is for big-picture life planning. It reads and writes to the system calendars on the iPhone, both local and those backed by cloud services like iCloud.

## The Grid

The advantage of Timescape is a full-screen grid view showing an entire year without gaps between the months. All events for the entire year are visible on the grid: all-day events, or days that span over multiple days, are shown as capsules. Events contained within a single day are shown as dots. Days in the past have reduced opacity until they are selected, to focus on the upcoming months.

Timescape intentionally does not allow you to zoom in on a month, week, or day: it is intended to be used as a big-picture planning tool. It's great for planning travel, being context-aware of events in your social circle, and thinking seriously about the time you have available.

Timescape's grid will adapt to the user's local calendar, e.g. starting the week on Sunday in the US while starting the week on Monday in the EU. The grid's short month names are automatically localised.

In v1.0, the user can see 2024, 2025 or 2026. Swiping on the grid changes year.

## Event Controls

When a day is selected by tapping on its square on the grid, or by using the controls at the bottom, any events on that day will be shown in a compact ribbon above the controls. This keeps focus on the grid.

Events can be created, edited, or deleted directly from Timescape. v1.0 a subset of the event properties provided by Apple's EventKit can be seen and modified.

## Calendar Filters

To keep focus on the big picture, Timescape allows you to hide calendars that you might want to see in a primary calendar app. This is part of onboarding, and can be changed at any time from settings.

## Pricing

Timescape has a hard paywall in onboarding. A monthly subscription is $0.99 or regional equivalents, while a yearly subscription is $4.99 or equivalents. Both include a 7-day free trial.

Users are encouraged in the paywall view to use the monthly subscription temporarily, as a planning tool when thinking about an upcoming year or season.

# About the Developer

I'm Matthew O'Donnell, a London-based developer with 5 years of experience. I'm a web developer by day, and make indie apps by night.

In 2024, I had a big physical wall calendar in my living room that I used in tandem with the Calendar app on my devices. I loved it, but it didn't sync, the events weren't colour-coded to my digital calendar system, and it was also a pain to only have access to it when I was at home. So here we are! ðŸ˜„
