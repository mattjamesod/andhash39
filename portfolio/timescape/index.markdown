Timescape is a calendar app that shows your entire year: 52 weeks in a grid, no gaps. It's great for planning travel, checking upcoming birthdays, or thinking seriously about the time you have available.

See you calendars come alive, as your colours for travel, work, family and everything else decorate your Timescape. You can see any day of the year with a single tap, and all the events on that day appear in a ribbon below the grid. 

It's easier to use than explain - give it a download, and check it out with a 7 day free trial!
