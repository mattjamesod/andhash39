<div>
	<p>Contextable is a flashcard app for language learners that lets you include context.</p>

	<p>When trying to remember vocabulary, it's easier and more useful to be presented with a setence or phrase containing the word. When you create cards for new words, Contextable lets you record that context.</p>
</div>

<img class="portfolio-banner-image" src="/assets/images/contextable.png" alt="Three Contextable views stacked on top of one another. The first is animated, and shows a stack of cards being flipped and then swiped right/left to mark them as succesfull remembered or not. The second is aa list of decks that can be reviewed, and the third is an index of cards.">

<div>
	<p>Maybe you encounter a word again, somewhere else, and don't recognise it: maybe the verb conjugation or noun declension is different. You can go to your card for that word and add a new context.</p>

	<p>Contextable is free and open source: you can read more on <a href="https://github.com/mattjamesod/flashcards">my GitHub page</a>!</p>
