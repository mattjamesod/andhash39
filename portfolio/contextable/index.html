<div>
	<p>Contextable is a flashcard app for language learners that lets you include context.</p>

	<p>When trying to remember vocabulary, it's easier and more useful to be presented with a setence or phrase containing the word. When you create cards for new words, Contextable lets you record that context..</p>
	
	<p>Maybe you encounter the word again, somewhere else, but don't recognise it: maybe the verb conjugation or noun declension is different. You can go to your card for that word and add a new context.</p>
	
	<p>In the context form, you can highlight where the word appears, letting you tag its different grammatical forms. You can also note where the context came from (a book, podcast, etc.)</p>
